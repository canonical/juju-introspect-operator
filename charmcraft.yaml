summary: Operator for controlling juju-introspect with systemd
description: |
  This simple operator is used to manage the `juju-introspect` tool using systemd.

  The charm installs a systemd unit that starts `juju-introspect`, listening on port 6000. It
  provides a relation that allows it to be scraped by Parca, or other profiling tools that can
  consume the golang pprof endpoints.
